                    Salix (pronounced <i>say-lix</i>) is a Go templating engine inspired by <a href="https://github.com/vapor/leaf">Leaf</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Salix's syntax is similar to Leaf and (in my opinion at least), it's much more fun to write than the Go template syntax. If you like this project, please star its repo. I hope you enjoy! :)
